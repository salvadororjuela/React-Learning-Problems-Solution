Define a new constant JSX that renders a div which contains the following elements in order:

An h1, a p, and an unordered list that contains three li items. You can include any text you 
want within each element.

Note: When rendering multiple elements like this, you can wrap them all in parentheses, but 
it's not strictly required. Also notice this challenge uses a div tag to wrap all the child 
elements within a single parent element. If you remove the div, the JSX will no longer 
transpile. Keep this in mind, since it will also apply when you return JSX elements in React 
components.



const JSX = 
<div>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>world</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firts</li>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Third</li>
  </ul>
</div>
