The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so 
it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.

Note: The text is considered a child of the div element, so you will not be 
able to use a self-closing tag.



const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line

return (
<div>
  <h1>Some String Of Text</h1>
</div>
);
  // Change code above this line
};
