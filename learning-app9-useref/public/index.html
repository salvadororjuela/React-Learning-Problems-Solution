    <h1>useRef Hook</h1>
    <p>
      The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. <br>
      It can be used to store a mutale value that does not cause a re-render when updated. <br>
      It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
    </p>

    <h2>Does Not Cause Re-Renders</h2>
    <p>
      If we tried to count how many times our application renders using the useState Hook, <br>
      we would be caught in an infinite loop since this Hook itself causes a re-render. <br>
      To avoid this, we can use the useRef Hook.
    </p>
    <h3>Example: Use useRef to track application renders.</h3>
    <div id="useRefApplicationRenders"></div>
    <p>
      useRef() only returns one item. It returns an Object called current. <br>
      When we initialize useRef we set the initial value: useRef(0). <br>
      It's like doing this: const count = {current: 0}. We can access the count by using count.current. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Accessing DOM Elements</h2>
    <p>
      In genera, we want to let React handle all DOM manipulations. <br>
      Bet there are some instances where useRef can be used without causing issues. <br>
      In React, we can add a ref Attribute to an element to access it directly in the DOM.
    </p>
    <h3>Example: Use useRef to focus the input:</h3>
    <div id="accessingDOMElements"></div>
    <hr>

    <h2>Tracking State Changes</h2>
    <p>
      The useRef Hook can also be used to keep track of previous state values. <br>
      This is because we are able to persist useRef values between renders.
    </p>
    <h3>Example: useRef to keep track of previous state values:</h3>
    <div id="trackingStateChanges"></div>
    <p>
      This time we use a combination of useState, useEffect, and useRef to keep track of the previous state. <br>
      In the useEffect, we are updating the useRef current value each time the inpuValue is updated by <br>
      entering text into the input field.
